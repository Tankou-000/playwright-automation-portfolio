# Playwright Automation Portfolio

This repository is my introduction to understanding Playwright code and browser automation.

Please note: these tests may pass or fail depending on the **mood of the internet**.  
They work â€” but sometimes slow network speeds say otherwise. ðŸ˜…

This repo is not meant to show perfect test outcomes.  
Itâ€™s here to show my **effort, structure, and learning** in real-time QA automation.

Use this as a snapshot of where Iâ€™m at in my journey â€” not a perfect benchmark.

Thanks for checking it out!
